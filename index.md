Hello, I'm Richard Helsingius. I'm studying Finance at Hanken School of Economics and am fortunate to apply some of what I learn as a Junior Analyst at a Fintech startup. Data has always intrigued me, and I'm constantly learning how it shapes our financial world. Beyond my professional and academic commitments, I enjoy staying active to maintain a balanced lifestyle.
